**_Imagine _**a life where all your time is spent on the things you want to do.

Imagine giving your greatest attention to a project you create yourself, instead of working as a cog in a machine that exists to make other people rich. Imagine handing a letter to your boss that reads, "Dear sir, I'm writing to let you know that your services are no longer required. Thanks for everything, but I'll be doing things my own way now."

Imagine that today is your final day of working for anyone other than yourself. What if, very soon, not in some distant, undefined future, you prepare for work by firing up a laptop in your home office, speaking with customers who love you, taking calls from those who trust you for helpful advice, or otherwise doing what you want instead of what someone tells you to do?

All over the world, and in many different ways, millions of people are doing exactly that. They are rewriting the rules of work, becoming their own bosses, and creating a new future for themselves and for others.

You can do the same.
